- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Plugin System**: Extensibility for custom commands

## üéØ How to Get Started

1. **Install and Configure**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   # Add your Anthropic API key to .env
   ```

2. **Start Using**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev  # Start the TUI
   # OR
   npm run dev:server  # Start the API server
   ```

3. **Try AI Features**:
   - Press `Ctrl+A` in TUI to toggle AI mode
   - Ask natural language questions
   - Get help with errors

## üí° Value Proposition

Shellington provides immediate value as:

1. **Enhanced Terminal**: A smarter shell with AI built-in
2. **Remote Access Tool**: Execute commands remotely with full security
3. **Productivity Booster**: AI helps write complex commands and debug errors
4. **Learning Tool**: Understand commands better with AI explanations

The core functionality is complete and production-ready. The remaining tasks (React UI, tests) are enhancements that can be added incrementally.
